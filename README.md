HOW WE MADE OUR CALCULATOR APP
The calculator app we made using python can perform arithmetic functions such as; addition, multiplication, division and subtraction.
We made this calculator app using python because python is a beginner friendly programming language which makes it an excellent choice for creating a calculator app. The syntax is simple to understand and allows users to simply understand the app. Creating calculator app using python can be a great learning experience for beginners, it allows you to be able to practice various programming concepts learnt such as; functions, loops and conditionals

THE STEPS IN MAKING THE CALCULATOR APP ARE AS FOLLOWS:
Step 1: Import Tkinter
In python you import the ‘tkinter’ library to create a calculator app with a Graphical User Interface (GUI):
Python 
Import tktinter as tk

Step2. Create a new python script
Open your code editor i.e. Pycharm and 
e.g calculator_app.py









Step 2: Create a new Python script
Open your favorite code editor and create a new Python script, for example, calculator_app.py.
Step 3: Import Tkinter
Include the Tkinter library at the beginning of your script:
python
from tkinter import *
Step 4: Create the main application window
Create the main application window using the Tkinter Tk class:
python
root = Tk()
root.title("Simple Calculator")
Step 5: Create an entry widget for input and display
Create an entry widget to take input and display results:
python
entry = Entry(root, width=20, borderwidth=5)
entry.grid(row=0, column=0, columnspan=4, padx=10, pady=10)
Step 6: Define functions for calculator operations
Create functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
python
def button_click(number):
    current = entry.get()
    entry.delete(0, END)
    entry.insert(0, str(current) + str(number))

def button_clear():
    entry.delete(0, END)

def button_add():
    first_number = entry.get()
    global f_num
    global math
    math = "addition"
    f_num = float(first_number)
    entry.delete(0, END)

# Similar functions for subtraction, multiplication, and division
Step 7: Create buttons for numbers and operations
Create buttons for numbers 0-9, decimal point, and basic operations:
python
button_1 = Button(root, text="1", padx=20, pady=20, command=lambda: button_click(1))
# Repeat for buttons 2-9, 0, and other operations

button_add = Button(root, text="+", padx=20, pady=20, command=button_add)
# Repeat for buttons "-", "*", "/", "="

button_clear = Button(root, text="C", padx=20, pady=20, command=button_clear)
Step 8: Organize buttons on the grid
Use the grid method to organize buttons in rows and columns:
python
# Organize number buttons
button_1.grid(row=3, column=0)
# Repeat for buttons 2-9, 0

# Organize operation buttons
button_add.grid(row=1, column=3)
# Repeat for buttons "-", "*", "/", "="

button_clear.grid(row=4, column=0)
Step 9: Create the main loop
Finally, start the main loop to run the application:
python
root.mainloop()
Step 10: Run the script
Save your script and run it using the Python interpreter:
bash
python calculator_app.py
This is a basic example to get you started. You can enhance and customize the calculator app by adding more features and improving the user interface.
